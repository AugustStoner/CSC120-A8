Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My class respresents a crow that can move around and interact with objects, putting them in its bag. The crow starts with one space in its bag, but it can be expanded and shrank using the grow() and shrink() methods. In addition to all of the interface methods, I added three more more user-directed methods, checkCapacity(), showInventory(), and showOptions() to make the item storage easier to understand. I also implemented a couple methods intended to be used mainly from within the class: contains(String item) and capacity(), which are used to simplify my code for the interface methods. 
Because most of my focus was on item storage and retrieval, it did not make sense for this assignment to develop advanced movement methods, though it did encourage me to begin thinking about how I might handle that aspect of the final project. I took a simple approach to the use(String item) method here, but I could also see it being useful in the future to have other information contained in a Hashtable or dictionary of some kind along with the name of an item, such as its use status or other relevant information that could be provided with examine(String item).
